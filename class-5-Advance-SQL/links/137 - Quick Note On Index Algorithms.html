<p>In the previous video you saw us using an index algorithm there was a small typo in the query that may cause some confusion.</p><p>The <code>WHERE</code> clause in one of the queries (at the 6 minute mark) was using the&nbsp; <code>AND</code> keyword for the country code check, this should have been&nbsp; <code>OR</code> as there is no possibility for the country code to match all of these values but only one at a time.</p>
