<p>When it comes to Regular Expressions there are many avenues to take to learn and apply this skill.&nbsp;It in itself is a language that crosses the barriers of each programming language and can be used to validate complex text patterns. Regex comes in multiple "flavours" or what we would like to call "variations". </p><p>It usually finds its place in applying validations to make sure what a user is inputting matches an expectation. That expectation could be anything:</p><ul><li><p>An e-mail</p></li><li><p>A phone number</p></li><li><p>An address</p></li><li><p>A postal code</p></li></ul><p>When it comes to data we often have unique ways of writing these things, and they vary from country to country so it is extremely important to be able to know what inputs are expected and validate/sanitize inputs so they match your expectation.</p><p>Different languages can have slight variations on how they choose to implement Regex, but they often do not differ heavily.</p><p>At the end of the day, what we want to achieve is clean data and we have all of these mechanisms in place to help us, writing constraints is a hard job.
