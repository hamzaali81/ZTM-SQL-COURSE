<p>Throughout this section, you will find that we are taking a slightly different approach. </p><p>When we approached querying it was beneficial to learn the concepts and what they do, applying them to certain scenarios.</p><p>Doing all that before touching on exercises builds a solid foundation for applying knowledge.</p><p>However, there are many different strategies to employ effective learning, throughout this bootcamp we’ve enjoyed everything from history to theory and practical exercises. In this section, you will find a healthy mix.</p><p>From the get-go our plan was to build a solid foundation for you to start off your SQL mastery, as with any technology there are multiple avenues to walk when exploring SQL.</p><p><strong>The avenue of data creation and management is one that often crosses the realm of architecture and administrator. You see on the one hand you have the definition and creation of databases and the relationships between different tables and on the other hand, you have the management of roles, permissions, backups, and so forth.</strong></p><p>Very different skills indeed, nevertheless extremely valuable to know and use, SQL is so much more than just querying data - it’s a <strong>lifestyle</strong>! I joke, but I also digress.</p><p>Throughout this section what you will find is a healthy mix of theory and practical application when it comes to management and the principles, as well as a practical example of database architecture and creation. </p><p><strong>There are many commands to master in this section, but the reality is once you go out there and start applying these skills that’s when the real learning will start, the foundation this course gives you sets you up for a life long journey of fun problem-solving with SQL!</strong></p>
