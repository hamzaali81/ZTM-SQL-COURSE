<p>Time to sharpen those skills, the following exercises are there to help you flex those SQL&nbsp;muscles you've just built!</p><p>In the previous videos, we learned a lot about logical operators, and how the can help us filter out data! Filtering data is essential to any query as you often will only need/want to work with a subset of that data. </p><p>Therefore, it is of absolute importance to master the <code>WHERE</code> clause!</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Reminder</strong></p><p><em>Exercises are grouped according to the database the should be executed against, as always our format is &lt;DatabaseName&gt;/&lt;Table&gt; which indicates against which database and table you should be working to get accurate results.</em></p><p><br></p><h4>Exercises</h4><p><a href="https://github.com/mobinni/Complete-SQL-Database-Bootcamp-Zero-to-Mastery/blob/master/SQL%20Deep%20Dive/Comparison%20Operators/questions.sql" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><strong>QUESTIONS ON GITHUB</strong></a></p><ol><li><p>How many female customers do we have from the state of Oregon (OR)?</p></li><li><p>Who over the age of 44 has an income of 100 000 or more?</p></li><li><p>Who between the ages of 30 and 50 has an income of less than 50 000?</p></li><li><p>What is the average income between the ages of 20 and 50?</p></li></ol><p><a href="https://gist.github.com/mobinni/016e5764b848e3e6278866c40afdad24" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><strong>REVEAL&nbsp;ANSWERS</strong></a></p><p><br></p><h4>Practice on the go with DB&nbsp;Fiddle</h4><p>If you are on your mobile device or otherwise not around your Postgres setup - feel free to use these DB&nbsp;Fiddles to help you practice solve the query for the exercises above. </p><p><strong>Reminder</strong></p><p><em>Please be aware that the results WILL vary as the DB&nbsp;Fiddle does not have the full tables or database available, this is because it would take a large amount of memory for our database to run on a website.</em></p><p><em>Also remember that each URL&nbsp;below is formatted as follows &lt;Database&gt;/&lt;TableName&gt; </em></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Links:</strong></p><p>Database:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.db-fiddle.com/f/upmzr6GdKYgJew2aXNrLpE/0" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Store/Customer</a></p><p><br></p>
