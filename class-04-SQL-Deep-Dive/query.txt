1. SELECT (Retrieve Data)
SELECT * FROM "employees";
SELECT * FROM "public"."employees";
SELECT emp_no, birth_date FROM "employees";

2.Renaming Columns.
SELECT emp_no AS a, birth_date FROM "employees";

3.Concat function (Concat between two columns):
SELECT CONCAT( emp_no, gender) AS empG FROM "employees";
SELECT concat(emp_no, ' is a ', title) FROM titles;
SELECT concat(emp_no, ' is a ', title) FROM titles;
SELECT concat(first_name, ' ', last_name) as "full name" FROM employees;

Aggregation:
max()
count()
min()
sum()
avg()

SELECT max( salary ) FROM salaries;
SELECT min( salary ) FROM salaries;
SELECT avg( salary ) FROM salaries;
SELECT sum( salary ) FROM salaries;
SELECT count( salary ) FROM salaries;

AND | WHERE (filter)
SELECT first_name, last_name FROM employees
WHERE first_name='Georgi' AND last_name='Facello'; 

ORDER OF OPERATION

SELECT first_name, last_name FROM employees
WHERE first_name='Georgi' AND last_name='Facello' AND first_name='Bezalel' AND last_name='Simmel';

SELECT first_name, last_name FROM employees
WHERE (first_name='Georgi' AND last_name='Facello') OR first_name='Bezalel' AND last_name='Simmel';

SELECT first_name, last_name FROM employees
WHERE (first_name='Georgi' AND last_name='Facello') OR (first_name='Bezalel' AND last_name='Simmel'); 


NOT
SELECT gender FROM customers
WHERE NOT gender = 'M';

SELECT gender FROM customers
WHERE NOT gender = 'M';

SELECT count(age) FROM customers
WHERE NOT age = 55 AND NOT age=20;


IS (Allows to filter values. That are NULL, NOT NULL, True or False)
SELECT first_name FROM employees
WHERE first_name IS NOT NULL;;

coalesce (Replace the null value)
SELECT COALESCE(name, 'no name'), first_name FROM "Student";
SELECT sum(COALESCE(age, 20)) FROM "Student";

Tricky Null Question

BETWEEN AND (Shorthand filter >= <=)
SELECT * FROM employees
WHERE emp_no BETWEEN 1 AND 10004;


IN (Check if a value matches any value in a list)
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE emp_no IN (1,10002)

LIKE (Partial Lookup)(What if you don't known exactly what you are searching)
SELECT * FROM employees
WHERE first_name LIKE 'G%ger'; 

LIKE (Partial Lookup)(Incase Sensitive)
SELECT * FROM employees
WHERE first_name ILIKE 'G%GER'; 

DATES:
SHOW TIMEZONE;
SET TIMEZONE 'UTC';

(Change timezone in system level)
ALTER  USER postgres SET timezone='UTC';
ALTER USER education SET timezone-'UTC';

TIMESTAMP (YYYY:MM:DTHH:MM:SS)
A timestamp is a date with time.

SELECT now()

INSERT  INTO timezone VALUES (
   TIMESTAMP WITHOUT TIME ZONE '2000-01-01 10:00:00-05'
   TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE '2000-01-01 10:00:00-05'
   );
    

CREATE  TABLE timezone( ts TIMESTAMP with time zone,
tz TIMESTAMP with time zone
 )

Date functions(); 2022-05-29 (Date-Format)

SELECT NOW()::date;
SELECT CURRENT_DATE;

SELECT TO_CHAR(CURRENT_DATE, 'dd/mm/yyyy');  --Learn postgress docs
SELECT TO_CHAR(CURRENT_DATE, 'DDD');

Data Difference and casting
SELECT date '1800/01/01';

Age Calculation:
SELECT AGE('1801/01/01'); --Error
SELECT AGE(date '1801/01/01'); 
SELECT AGE(date '1992/11/13', date '1800/01/01'); --Calculate age between

EXTRACT (e.g Extract a day)
SELECT EXTRACT (DAY FROM date '1992/11/13') AS Day;
SELECT EXTRACT (YEAR FROM date '1992/11/13') AS Year;

Trucate (Round of date)
SELECT DATE_TRUNC( 'year',  date '1992/11/13');

INTERVAL (Talk about time in a readable manner):
Interval Allow us to write queries in a way that mirrors language. 

SELECT * FROM orders WHERE purchaseDate <=now()-interval '30 days';
SELECT * FROM orders WHERE orderDate <= now()-interval '30 days';
SELECT * from orders;

DISTINCT (Remove Duplicates)
Distinct clauses keeps one row for each group of duplicates.

SELECT DISTINCT emp_no FROM employees;

ORDER BY: Sorting (ASC/DSC)

SELECT * FROM customers ORDER BY firstname ASC;
SELECT * FROM customers ORDER BY firstname DESC;
SELECT * FROM customers;

Using Expressions
SELECt * FROM customers ORDER BY LENGTH(name);


LENGTH (Expression)
SELECT firstname, lastname FROM employees 
ORDER BY LENGTH(first_name) DESC;

SELECT firstname, lastname FROM customers 
ORDER BY LENGTH(firstname) DESC;

Inner JOIN (Link Column to another table) (Not use where - ON use):

SELECT a.emp_no, b.salary, b.from_date, c.title 
FROM employees AS a 
INNER JOIN salaries AS b ON b.emp_no = a.emp_no
INNER JOIN titles AS c ON c.emp_no = a.emp_no AND c.from_date = b.from_date
AND (b.from_date + INTERVAL '2 days') = c.from_date
ORDER BY a.emp_no ASC, b.from_date ASC;

Self-Join:


OUTER JOIN:
SELECT emp.emp_no, dep.emp_no
FROM employees AS emp
LEFT JOIN dept_manager AS dep ON emp.emp_no = dep.emp_no
WHERE dep.emp_no IS NOT NULL;

SELECT count( emp.emp_no )
FROM employees AS emp
LEFT JOIN dept_manager AS dep ON emp.emp_no = dep.emp_no
WHERE dep.emp_no IS NOT NULL;
------------------------------------------------------------------
JOIN:
A JOIN clause is used to combine rows from two or more tables, based on a related column between them.



INNER JOIN:
The INNER JOIN keyword selects records that have matching values in both tables.
Syntax:
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table1
INNER JOIN table2
ON table1.column_name = table2.column_name;

SELECT * FROM patients 
join admissions ON patients.patient_id = admissions.patient_id;

LEFT OUTER JOIN:
The LEFT JOIN keyword returns all records from the left table (table1), 
and the matching records from the right table (table2). 
The result is 0 records from the right side, if there is no match.

SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table1
LEFT JOIN table2
ON table1.column_name = table2.column_name;

SELECT Customers.CustomerName, Orders.OrderID
FROM Customers
LEFT JOIN Orders ON Customers.CustomerID = Orders.CustomerID
ORDER BY Customers.CustomerName;

RIGHT OUTER JOIN
The RIGHT JOIN keyword returns all records from the right table (table2), 
and the matching records from the left table (table1). 
The result is 0 records from the left side, if there is no match.

Note: In some databases RIGHT JOIN is called RIGHT OUTER JOIN.


SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table1
RIGHT JOIN table2
ON table1.column_name = table2.column_name;

SELECT Orders.OrderID, Employees.LastName, Employees.FirstName
FROM Orders
RIGHT JOIN Employees ON Orders.EmployeeID = Employees.EmployeeID
ORDER BY Orders.OrderID;

SQL FULL OUTER JOIN Keyword
The FULL OUTER JOIN keyword returns all records 
when there is a match in left (table1) or right (table2) table records.

Tip: FULL OUTER JOIN and FULL JOIN are the same.

FULL OUTER JOIN Syntax
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table1
FULL OUTER JOIN table2
ON table1.column_name = table2.column_name
WHERE condition;


SQL Self Join
A self join is a regular join, but the table is joined with itself.

Self Join Syntax
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table1 T1, table1 T2
WHERE condition;
